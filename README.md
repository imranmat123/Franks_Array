Exercise 7 "Frank's Array" on Udemy

In this exercise, you are given a C++ program that initializes an array of 10 integers to 0 using uniform initialization syntax. The program then outputs the values of each element in the array by accessing them using their respective indices from 0 to 9, and explains that arrays in C++ are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element is at index 0.

Next, the program tries to access the value of the 11th element of the array, which is not possible as the array only has 10 elements, and produces undefined behavior. The program then goes on to modify the values of the first and last elements of the array to 100 and 1000, respectively, and outputs the updated values of each element using a similar loop.

Finally, the program converts the array to a vector using a vector constructor that takes two arguments: the beginning and end iterators of the array. The program returns 0, indicating that the program ran successfully.

This exercise serves as a good introduction to arrays in C++ and how they work. It also highlights the importance of indexing arrays correctly and avoiding out-of-bounds errors that can lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, it demonstrates how arrays can be converted to vectors using the vector constructor, which is a useful technique when working with arrays in C++.
